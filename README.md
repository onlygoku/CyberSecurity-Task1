# CyberSecurity-Task1
# Task 1: Local Network Security Scan

# Objective
The goal of this task was to perform a security scan on my local network to discover active devices and identify any open ports. This helps in understanding the network's overall security posture and potential vulnerabilities.

# Tools Used
Nmap: Used for network discovery and port scanning.

# Process
1.  First, I identified my local network's IP address range.
2.  I then executed an Nmap TCP SYN scan (`nmap -sS`) against this range to find live hosts and their open ports.
3.  The scan results were analyzed to identify the services running on each open port.
4.  Finally, I assessed the potential security risks associated with these exposed services and documented the findings.

# Summary of Findings
The scan successfully identified multiple devices on the network. For security and privacy, the specific local IP addresses have been anonymized in this summary.

# Router ([ROUTER_IP]): Found standard open ports for DNS (53) and web administration (80, 443, 8080). The main potential risk here is a weak or default administrator password for the web interface.
# Windows PC ([WINDOWS_PC_IP]): Discovered open ports related to Windows file sharing (135, 139, 445). These services can be a security risk if the operating system is not kept up-to-date with security patches, as they have been targeted by malware in the past.
